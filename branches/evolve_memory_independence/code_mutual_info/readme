- Extract pair of features (scaled to 0-1) from the MNIST SVD vectors by running
python dump_features.py
                          OR 
- Dump pair of vectors from MATLAB (scaled to 0-1). If pairs are normally distributed, 
  can calculate exact value of mutual information 

- Output data files (scaled to 0-1)

- Scaling/Normalizing to (0-1) is requirement for both the Fast Kraskov code and Histogram code. 
  Currently, NN outputs are sigmoids so already their values lie in the range of 0-1. 
  Kraskov is sensitive to any extra scaling (because of maxdist(X, Y)). Therefore, avoid scaling NN outputs
  before calculating their mutual information.

***********   For C++ (Both Kraskov and Histogram approach) *********
g++ main.cpp ../../kraskovmi.cpp histogram_mi.h
a.out

***********   For Python (Histogram approach) *********
python mutual_info.py

***********   For Matlab (Kraskov approach) *********
- Edit code to read del_X.txt and del_Y.txt or dump new vector pair
X = dlmread('del_X.txt');
Y = dlmread('del_Y.txt');
kraskov_top.m
