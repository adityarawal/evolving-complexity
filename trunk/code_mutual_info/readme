- Extract pair of features (scaled to 0-1) from the MNIST SVD vectors by running
python dump_features.py
                          OR 
- Dump pair of vectors from MATLAB (scaled to 0-1). If pairs are normally distributed, 
  can calculate exact value of mutual information 

- Output data files (scaled to 0-1)

- Scaling is requirement for both the Kraskov code and Histogram code.
 
***********   For C++ (Both Kraskov and Histogram approach) *********
g++ main.cpp ../../kraskovmi.cpp histogram_mi.h
a.out

***********   For Python (Histogram approach) *********
python mutual_info.py

***********   For Matlab (Kraskov approach) *********
- Edit code to read del_X.txt and del_Y.txt or dump new vector pair
X = dlmread('del_X.txt');
Y = dlmread('del_Y.txt');
kraskov_top.m
